# Abstract
The recent spread of the COVID-19 virus has placed an incredible strain on the worldwide healthcare system. Intelligent allocation of limited medical resources during a crisis is critical for preventing a collapse of the healthcare system and treating the greatest number of people possible. This project aims to assist hospitals allocate limited beds, personal protective equipment, and staff during the early stages of a developing outbreak.

Given a dataset of COVID-19 patients that includes demographic data, medical history and a time series of vitals/blood test results, we build several predictors that predict whether or not that patient will need ICU care in the near future. The classifiers we built were based on Multi-tiered Logistic Regression, Multi-tiered Ridge Regression, k-nearest neighbors, and multi-layer perceptron. The results of these predictors can be used to triage individual COVID cases, even before severe symptoms may become apparent.
